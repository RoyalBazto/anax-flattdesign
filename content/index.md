A website using Anax Flat
===============================

Hi there lets not try to screw this one up, ok!

Nice of you to stop by.

<img src="img/reinhardt.png" alt="alt text">

This is a website created using Anax Flat as a base. This is the base website to be used in the dbwebb course *design*.

Its going to be extreamly exiting! Just hang in there! You can do it, never be afraid because everyone is a beginner at some point!
If you get behind its not because you are not as good as the others they are just not beginners anymore. Soon you aswell will be a pro!
may the Anax Flat be with you!

Cheers and happy building of websites,
